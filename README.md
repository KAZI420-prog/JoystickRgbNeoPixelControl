This is made for a Raspberry Pico. 
Connect up your neopixels with the signal wire to GPIO Pin 0, your positive wire to your VBus or Pin 40 for Pico 2 W. 
Connect both grounds to Pin 38. 
Connect 5V up to Pin 36 which is your 3V Pin as the joystick does not need 5V for this.
Connect VRx to GPIO Pin 27.
Connect VRy to GPIO Pin 26.
Copy code, and enoy!
